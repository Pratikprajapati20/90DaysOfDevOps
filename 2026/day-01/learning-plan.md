# Introduction of Devops and Cloud

## Task
Today’s I set my goal **for DevOps journey**.

You will create a **90-day personal DevOps learning plan** that clearly defines:

- **What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?**

  Devops is a culture , mindset to collaborate developer and operations team to reduce maximum time to serve market.
 
- **Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?**

  I have been working as a web developer for the past 7 years. Two years ago, I moved to Canada and have been trying to find a job as a PHP developer. However, I’ve noticed that there are fewer opportunities here compared to India, as many companies outsource development work to India. Therefore, I want to upgrade my skills in DevOps or Cybersecurity.**

- **Where do you want to reach?**

  I want to get a good job with handsome package. Also, lerarne how to make a video and start youtube chanel to help community as much as possible.
